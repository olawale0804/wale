<li><h3>server</h3> <li>: is the dedicated machine on the internet which jobs is to serve out document which the client request for.</li><br>

HTPP= Hypertext transfer protocol<br>
*ISP= Internet service provider<br>
*URL= Uniform resource locator.<br>
*DNS= domain name system(contain all the adresses that the server stores IP adresses of all websites).<br>
 The very first page we get when we type a URL is called an homepage.<br>
The page displayed on our screen consist of three files namely;<br>
<li>HTML (hypertext markup language); used in structuring our webpage.</li>
<li>CSS (cascading style sheet); for styling the webpage.</li>

  		<p><b> COMPUTER SCIENCE</b></p>
  		<p>computer science is the study of computer and computational systems.Unlike electrical and computer scientists deal mostly with software and software system;this includes their theory,design,development, and application

		Principle areas of study within computer science includee artifical intelligencee,computer systems and networks,security,database system,human computer interaction,vision,vision and graphics ,numerical analysis,programminng languages,software enginnering,bioinformatics and theory of computing. Althriugh knowing how to program is essemtial to the study of computer science. it ie only the element of the field. Computer scientists design and analyze algorithms that solve them-to the tangible-designing applications that perform well on handheld devices,that are easy to use,and that uphold security measure.</p>
